                    <p>• Developed a comprehensive web vulnerability scanner in Python to identify common security vulnerabilities in
                        websites and web applications, adhering to the OWASP Top 10 guidelines.
                        </p>
                    <p>• Implemented scanning modules to perform automated vulnerability assessments, including SQL injection, cross-site
                        scripting (XSS), insecure direct object references (IDOR), and other critical vulnerabilities.</p>
                    <p>• Generated detailed vulnerability reports highlighting identified issues, including severity ratings, exploitability assessments, and recommended remediation steps.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/Harsh5922/Vuln-Scanner"><h3>Network Firewall</h3></a>
                    <p>• Designed and implemented a network firewall using Python, utilizing various built-in libraries for packet capturing
                        and analysis.
                        </p>
                    <p>• Developed functionalities to capture and analyze network packets in real-time, allowing for the detection of suspicious
                        or unauthorized activity.</p>
                    <p>• Implemented rule-based filtering mechanisms to regulate traffic entering the network based on predefined criteria
                        such as protocols, IP addresses, port numbers, and packet contents.</p>
